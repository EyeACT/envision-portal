# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how the Envision Portal ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our platform and related services. By using the Envision Portal, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. What We Collect

We may collect the following types of information when you use the Envision Portal:

- **Account information:** such as your name, email address, affiliation, and password when you create an account.
- **Access request details:** information you provide when requesting access to controlled datasets (for example, your name, affiliation, email, and intended use of the data).
- **Usage information:** technical information about how you use the platform, such as IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps, and basic analytics.
- **Support and feedback:** information you provide if you contact us with questions, feedback, or bug reports (for example via the contact form or GitHub issues).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for purposes including:

- Creating and managing your user account;
- Processing and tracking dataset access requests and ensuring appropriate use of controlled data;
- Operating, maintaining, and improving the Envision Portal and its features;
- Monitoring service performance and security (for example, using logs and basic analytics);
- Communicating with you about your account, access requests, or updates to our services and policies;
- Supporting research reporting and platform evaluation in aggregate form (for example, number of users, dataset usage counts).

## 3. Cookies and Analytics

The Envision Portal may use cookies or similar technologies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and understand how the platform is used. Any analytics we use are intended to help improve usability, performance, and reliability. We do not sell your personal information.

## 4. Sharing of Information

We may share information in the following situations:

- **Project collaborators:** with members of the FAIR Data Innovations Hub team and collaborating institutions (such as the University of Washington and Kaiser Permanente Washington) as needed to operate and improve the Envision Portal.
- **Service providers:** with trusted third-party vendors that provide infrastructure or related services (for example, cloud hosting) under appropriate agreements.
- **Legal or safety reasons:** if we are required to do so by law, regulation, or valid legal process, or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, safety, or security of users, study participants, or our collaborators.

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

## 5. Data Security

We use technical and organizational measures to help protect information processed through the Envision Portal, including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), role-based access controls for non-public data, and regularly updated systems. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the Portal, support research and reporting, meet legal or institutional requirements, and maintain auditability of dataset access. When information is no longer needed, we aim to delete or anonymize it in a reasonable timeframe.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as:

- Requesting access to the information we hold about you;
- Requesting corrections to inaccurate or incomplete information;
- Requesting deletion of certain information, where appropriate;
- Limiting or objecting to certain types of processing, where permitted by law.

## 8. Third-Party Links and Services

The Envision Portal may link to other websites or services, such as external documentation, code repositories, or dataset hosts. This Privacy Policy applies only to the Envision Portal. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party sites or services.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date below. Your continued use of the Envision Portal after changes are posted means you accept the updated policy.
