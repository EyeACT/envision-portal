## 1. Definitions

For the purposes of these Terms:

- **"Envision Portal" or "Portal"** means the cloud-based, open-source platform for managing, curating, and sharing eye imaging data and associated metadata.
- **"Services"** means all functionality provided through the Portal, including dataset browsing, access request workflows, submission workflows for invited contributors, and related tools.
- **"User", "you"** means any individual or entity that accesses or uses the Portal.
- **"Dataset"** means any collection of data, files, documentation, or metadata made available through the Portal.
- **"Contributor"** means a User who submits or manages Datasets in the Portal.

- Maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials; and
- Be responsible for all activities that occur under your account.

## 3. Nature of the Service

The Envision Portal is designed to support researchers, data stewards, and AI/ML developers working with eye imaging datasets. The Portal:
